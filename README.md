Overview of the RadioButtons App
As a class assignment, I made this Android application to show how to use RadioButtons and dynamic UI updates in Android development. The application offers an easy-to-use interface for choosing a product from a list, displaying the name and price of the chosen item. It features basic Android UI elements and was constructed with Android Studio.

Qualities
a list of products with matching photos presented in an eye-catching arrangement.
Users can choose one product at a time with RadioButtons.
On a button, the name and price of the chosen product are dynamically displayed.
An easy-to-use interface that is perfect for teaching and learning the fundamentals of Android development.
Tech Stack Language: Kotlin or Java, depending on how you implement it
IDE: UI for Android Studio Parts: Button, ImageView, TextView, and RadioButton
How It Operates
A list of products is displayed with an image of each one.
By tapping the appropriate RadioButton, the user chooses a product.
When a product is selected, the app refreshes the button at the bottom to show the name and price of the chosen item.
