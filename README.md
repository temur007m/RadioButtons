RadioButtons App
Overview
As part of a class assignment, I developed this Android application to demonstrate the use of RadioButtons and dynamic UI updates in Android development. The app features an intuitive interface for selecting a product from a list and displays the name and price of the selected item. Built using Android Studio, the app incorporates fundamental Android UI components and is an excellent example of beginner-level app development.

Features
A visually appealing layout showcasing a list of products with corresponding images.
RadioButtons that allow users to select one product at a time.
Dynamic updates of the selected product's name and price displayed on a button.
A simple and easy-to-use interface, ideal for learning and teaching the basics of Android development.
Tech Stack
Language: Kotlin or Java 
IDE: Android Studio
UI Components: Button, ImageView, TextView, and RadioButton
How It Works
A list of products is displayed, each with a corresponding image.
The user selects a product by tapping the associated RadioButton.
Once selected, the app dynamically updates the button at the bottom to display the name and price of the chosen product.
